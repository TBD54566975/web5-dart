/// A class representing the result of a DID (Decentralized Identifier)
/// resolution.
///
/// This class encapsulates the metadata and document information obtained as
/// a result of resolving a DID. It includes the resolution metadata, the DID
/// document (if available), and the document metadata.
///
/// The `DidResolutionResult` can be initialized with specific metadata and
/// document information, or it can be created with default values if no
/// specific information is provided.
///
/// Instances of this class can also be converted to a JSON representation
/// suitable for transmission or storage.
///
/// Example Usage:
/// ```dart
/// var resolutionResult = DidResolutionResult(
///   didResolutionMetadata: customResolutionMetadata,
///   didDocument: customDidDocument,
///   didDocumentMetadata: customDocumentMetadata,
/// );
/// ```
///
/// [Specification Reference](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#resolution)

  /// if the DID could not be resolved or if the document is not available.

  /// empty `DidDocumentMetadata`.

  /// and document metadata. If these parameters are not provided, default values are used.
